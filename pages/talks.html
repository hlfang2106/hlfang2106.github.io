    <p>Title: The Kesten problem in higher dimensions
	    <br>Matthew Welsh (University of Maryland), 4/3, 14:10PM-15:10PM, Room 412 Zhihua Building <br></p>
    <p>Abstract: For an irrational $\alpha$ and an interval $ I = [x, x +u] \subset \RR/\ZZ$, consider the discrepancy $D_N(\alpha, x, u)$ 
	    between the number of $n \leq N$ with $n \alpha \pmod 1 $ in $I$ and the expected number, $uN$. In the 1960s, Kesten proved 
	    that if $\alpha$ and $x$ are taken uniformly at random, then $D_N$ normalized by $\rho(u) \log N$ converges to a Cauchy 
	    distribution. Similar results are known in higher dimensions due to work by Dolgopyat and Fayad; however with extra randomness 
	    akin to taking $u$ random as well. In work in progress with Dolgopyat and Fayad, we succeed in removing this extra randomness 
	    by proving extensions of equidistribution results on $\SL(d, \RR ) \ltimes \RR^d$ modulo $\SL(d, \ZZ) \ltimes \ZZ^d$ due to 
	    Strombergsson and Kim.

    <p>Title: Covariant derivative of eigenfunctions along parallel tensors
	    <br>Fei Qi (University of Denver), 3/27, 14:10PM-15:10PM, Room 412 Zhihua Building <br></p>
    <p>Abstract: The study is motivated by constructing the two-dimensional quantum nonlinear sigma model with the nonflat target manifold
	    via vertex algebraic methods. When the target manifold is not flat, the zero modes of the vertex operators act via 
	    covariant derivatives. Thus, the vertex operators are expected to be noncommutative. To understand such vertex operators,
	    the first step is to understand the covariant derivatives. In this talk, I will report my work on the covariant 
	    derivatives of eigenfunctions along the parallel tensors. Surprisingly, over a Riemannian manifold with constant 
	    nonzero sectional curvature, all the covariant derivatives are scalar multiples of the eigenfunction. We suspect that over 
	    Kahler and Calabi-Yau manifolds, the covariant derivatives of an eigenfunction might span a finite-dimensional space.

	    <br>Lawrence Ein (University of Illinois at Chicago), 3/21, 10:00AM-11:00AM, Room 412 Zhihua Building <br></p>
    <p>Abstract:  We discuss the results of Bertram-Ein-Lazarsfeld on effective Serre's vanishing theorem ant its applications.

    <p>Title:  Holomorphicity of totally geodesic isometries between bounded symmetric domains
	    <br>Sung-Yeon Kim (IBS, Korea), 3/11, 13:00PM-14:00PM, Room 413 Zhihua Building <br></p>
    <p>Abstract: The holomorphicity of isometries between complex manifolds is
a classical topic in complex differential geometry going back to the work of Siu
for strong rigidity of compact K¨ahler manifolds. In this talk, we investigate
the properties of totally geodesic isometric embedding $f:\Omega\rightarrow\Omega'$ between two
bounded symmetric domains $\Omega$ and $\Omega'$ with respect to their Bergman/Kobayashi
metrics. In particular, we discuss the question of holomorphicity of totally
geodesic isometric discs $f:\Delta\rightarrow\Omega$ that extend sufficiently smooth up to the
boundary. As an application, we give a sufficient condition for a totally geodesic
isometric embedding $f:\Omega\rightarrow\Omega'$ to be holomorphic or anti-holomorphic. This
is a joint work with Aeryeong Seo.

    <p>Title: Hilbert quotients and Hilbert families of Grassmannians
	    <br>Yi Hu (University of Arizona), 1/16, 14:00PM-16:00PM, Room 412 Zhihua Building <br></p>
    <p>Abstract: By Mnev’s universality theorem, every singularity type naturally occurs in matroid strata of Grassmannians. This motivates to study the Hilbert quotients and Hilbert families of Grassmannians. 

In this talk, we begin with a quick review of Mnev’s universality, a gentle introduction of Hilbert quotient, then introduce the structures of the Hilbert quotients and Hilbert families of Grassmannians and explain their implications.

The talk is made accessible for the general audience with a background in algebraic geometry.

    <p>Title: Intersection theoretic inequalities via Lorentzian polynomials
	    <br>Jian Xiao (Tsinghua University), 12/27, 15:30PM-16:30PM, Room 312 Zhihua Building <br></p>
    <p>Abstract:  The theory of Lorentzian polynomials was recently introduced and systematically developed by Braden-Huh and independently (with part overlap) by 
	    Anari-Liu-Gharan-Vinzant. It has many important applications in combinatorics, including a resolution of  the strongest version of Mason conjecture and 
	    new proofs of the Heron-Rota-Welsh conjecture. In this talk, we explore its applications to geometry. In particular, we establish a series of intersection 
	    theoretic inequalities, which we call rKT property.  We will discuss the origin of the rKT property in analytic geometry, and its connections with the 
	    submodularity for numerical dimension type functions and the sumset estimates for volume type functions. Joint work with J. Hu.

    <p>Title: Plateau问题，极小集，以及奇点分类
	    <br>Xiangyu Liang (Beihang University), 12/20, 13:30PM-14:30PM, Room 412 Zhihua Building <br></p>
    <p>Abstract: Plateau问题是19世纪同名物理学家提出的给定边界能量极小物理对象存在性及局部结构 刻划的著名古典问题。至今一直备受关注,其在三维空间最特殊情况下的解使Douglas获首届菲尔兹奖;
	    此后为应对一般情况下广泛存在的奇点现象，许多顶尖数学家针对该问题持续研究,发展出几何测度论。因其复杂性,人们对Plateau问题解局部结构的认识仍非常有限,很多基本问题未解决,包括正则性,奇点分类,切结构唯一性。
	    在这次报告中，我们将首先介绍Plateau问题，并讨论一些经典的数学模型。 这些模型中，Almgren极小集模型所得到的奇点类型恰与物理中所能观测到的肥皂膜奇点类型相吻合。
	    因此随后我们将以Almgren极小集模型为例，进一步介绍局部结构的研究思路。如果时间允许，我们将进一步讨论奇点分类以及相关的最新进展。

    <p>Title: Hodge-Riemann property of Griffiths positive matrices with (1,1)-form entries
	    <br>Zhangchi Chen (CAS), 12/13, 15:30PM-16:30PM, Room 412 Zhihua Building <br></p>
    <p>Abstract: The classical Hard Lefschetz theorem (HLT), Hodge-Riemann bilinear relation theorem (HRR) and Lefschetz decomposition theorem (LD) are stated for a power 
	    of a Kähler class on a compact Kähler manifold. These theorems are not true for an arbitrary class, even if it contains a smooth strictly positive 
	    representative. Explicit counterexamples of bidegree (2,2) classes in dimension 4 can be found in Timorin (1998) and Berndtsson-Sibony (2002). Dinh-Nguyên (2006, 2013) 
	    proved the mixed HLT, HRR, LD for a product of arbitrary Kähler classes. Instead of products, they asked whether determinants of Griffiths positive $k\times k$ 
	    matrices with (1,1) form entries in C^n satisfies these theorems in the linear case. In a recent work I gave positive answer when k=2 and n=2,3. Moreover, 
	    assume that the matrix only has diagonalized entries, for k=2 and $n\geq 4$, the determinant satisfies HLT for bidegrees (n−2,0), (n−3,1), (1,n−3) and (0,n−2).
	    In particular, Dinh-Nguyên's question has positive answer when k=2 and n=4,5 with this extra assumption. The proof uses a Heron's formula type factorization, 
	    observed by computer (Mathematica).

    <p>Title: The regularity problem for axially symmetric Navier-Stokes equations on some bounded regions
	    <br>Xin Yang (Southeast University), 11/29, 15:30PM-16:30PM, Room 412 Zhihua Building <br></p>
    <p>Abstract: The regularity problem of the Navier-Stokes equations (NS) in $\mathbb R^3$ asks whether a global smooth solution exists for any initial velocity 
	    $v_0$ that is divergence free and lies in the Schwartz class $\mathcal S(\mathbb R^3)$. This problem is still wide open in general for large initial 
	    values, and one of the essential barriers is the supercriticality of the (NS). If confining attention to axially symmetric vector fields, it was 
	    observed that the axially symmetric Navier-Stokes equations (ASNS) are critical after some proper transformations, which raises some hope to settle 
	    the regularity problem for (ASNS). Despite this problem on $\mathbb R^3$ remains open as well, it was solved recently on some particular bounded cusp 
	    domains with a Navier-slip boundary condition. Motivated by this work, we continue to study the regularity problem for (ASNS) on more regular and more 
	    realistic bounded regions than those cusp domains under the Navier-Hodge-Lions (NHL) boundary condition.

    <p>Title: Entire curves generating all shapes of Nevanlinna currents<br>Song-Yan Xie (CAS), 11/22, 15:30PM-16:30PM, Room 208 Zhihua Building <br></p>
    <p>Abstract: First, we show that every complex torus $\mathbb{T}$ contains some entire curve $g: \mathbb{C}\rightarrow \mathbb{T}$ such that the concentric 
	    holomorphic discs $\{g\restriction_{\overline{\mathbb D}_{r}}\}_{r>0}$ can generate all the Nevanlinna/Ahlfors currents on $\mathbb T$ at 
	    cohomological level. This confirms an anticipation of Sibony. Developing further our new method, we can construct some twisted entire curve 	 
$f: \mathbb{C}\rightarrow \mathbb{CP}^1\times E$ in the product of the rational curve $\mathbb{CP}^1$ and an elliptic curve $E$, such that, concerning Siu's decomposition,
	     demanding any cardinality $|J|\in \mathbb{Z}_{\geqslant 0}\cup \{\infty\}$ and that $\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{diff}}$ is trivial ($|J|\geqslant 1$) or not ($|J|\geqslant 0$), 
	     we can always find a sequence of concentric holomorphic discs $\{f\restriction_{\overline{\mathbb D}_{r_j}}\}_{j\geqslant 1}$ to generate a Nevanlinna/Ahlfors current
	     $\mathcal{T}=\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{alg}}+\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{diff}}$ with the singular part $\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{alg}}=\sum_{j\in J} \,\lambda_j\cdot[\mathsf C_j]$ in
	    the desired shape. This fulfills the missing case where $|J|=0$ in the previous work of Huynh-Xie. By a result of Duval, each $\mathsf C_j$ must be rational or elliptic. 
	    We will show that there is no a priori restriction on the numbers of rational and elliptic components in the support of $\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{alg}}$, thus answering a
	     question of Yau and Zhou. Moreover, we will show that the positive coefficients $\{\lambda_j\}_{j\in J}$ can be arbitrary as long as the total mass of
 $\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{alg}}$ is less than or equal to $1$.  Our results foreshadow striking holomorphic flexibility of entire curves in Oka geometry, which deserves further exploration.
	    This is joint work with Hao Wu (NUS).
